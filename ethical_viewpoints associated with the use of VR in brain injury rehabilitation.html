<h1>Ethical Viewpoints associated with the use of VR in brain injury rehabilitation</h1><br>
There are a few ethical issues associated with using virtual reality for brain damage rehabilitation. 
<h3>Informed Consent</h3><br>
A study was conducted where approximately 2000 patients admitted to a Trauma Centre were asked to give consent about whether they would like to be included in a hypothetical research trial (Dutton et al., 2008). The study found a third of patients had strong impairment issues preventing them from providing informed consent. The remaining portion of patients who were able to give consent were substantially less injured than those unable to provide consent. Although this study is not specifically targeted at brain injury patients, there are similarities with brain injury patients and patients at the trauma centre. In regards to brain injury patients, there are ethical questions around which patients can provide informed consent and which patients are unable to provide informed consent and do the patients who are unable to provide informed consent go without receiving virtual reality treatment or should the decision be made by another party. Is it ethical for the decision to be made by another party?
<br>
<h3>Privacy and Confidentiality</h3><br>
Sensitive and personal information is collected throughout the patient rehabilitation stage regarding the patients’ medical history and current injuries. It is important that this information be kept private and confidential in accordance with the patient’s wishes and if it were to be reported on; for example in research; it should be communicated in a responsible with full consent granted by the patient to use the information. 
A paper was written highlighting some privacy concerns regarding some work conducted by neuroimaging researchers. The paper explained that the researchers intended to collect images of brain MRI scans of patients, (Kulynych, 2002).  Although all identifying information about the patient was removed from the header of the scan and any additional data files sent with the scan, the scan itself included an image of the front of the face of the patient undergoing the scan which would clearly identify the patient (Kulynych, 2002). Although it was not the immediate intention of the neuroimaging researchers to breach the patient’s privacy, it is clear to see in this instance that there is a lack of standard protocols regarding patient privacy and this could be easily transferable in the virtual reality space as MRI scans could be done to monitor brain activity after the Virtual Reality treatment.

<h3>Potential for reduced human interaction </h3><br>
As the virtual world takes over, there is a risk of reduced human interaction specifically around a therapist/patient interaction.
The topic of the therapist and patient relationship was explored and has been sited that this relationship is a crucial component in treatment and rehabilitation (Schulteis & Rothbaum, 2002). (Schulteis & Rothbaum, 2002) mention that through the use of head mounted displays and computer monitors many non-visual and nonverbal cues including hand gestures that would generally be detected by a therapist while assessing the patient can be missed in determining the overall success of rehabilitation in the patient.
