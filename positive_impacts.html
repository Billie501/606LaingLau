<h3>Effectiveness compared to tradiotnal therapies</h3>
	<p>There are some effectiveness of the use of Virtual Reality (VR) for rehabilitation compared to cognitive rehabilitation. In a study conducting of 100 patients with mild to moderate Traumatic Brain Injury between the ages of 30 to 50 years of age which 56% where male and 34% were female which took part in a test where 50% did a Cognitive rehabilitation and another 50% did Virtual Reality rehabilitation (Mary H Kosmidis…2019). Results were quite similar around the same age group and gender considering its value to be p = 0.22 and        p = 0.22 in gender (Mary H Kosmidis…2019). Both treatments were helpful in treating patients with TBI especially in mood. Patients receiving VRT(virtual reality treatment) outperformed those receiving conventional therapy in the areas of cognition and mood. The cognitive flexibility, attention, executive skills, and visuospatial abilities that are crucial for daily functioning were all improved by VRT. Previous research on a range of neurological illnesses has also shown that VRT has beneficial benefits on cognition, motor function, and attention. The process with this type of technology is still evolving however according to (Dahdah et al. 2017) it is concluded test and data like this makesVR more effective in improve functions and speed of information processing of patients with TBI as this include motivation, and enjoyment of patients leading to a successful cause compared to traditional therapies.</p>
	
<h3>Provides better stimulation of real-life situations</h3>
	<p>Virtual Reality treatment helps with real life situations. A study in Japan of 24 patients with TBI between the ages 18 and 65 were experimented with using an ATM in VR and applying it into real life situations (Kenneth NK Fong…2010). Two groups were experimented that concludes first group for patients to be taught with using an ATM using VR learning the ability of using debit cards, withdrawals and deposits unlike first group, the second group were taught using powerpoints rather in a virtual environment. Results showed Group 1 succeeded in learning a real ATM at an average time of 15.5 seconds and those who failed had an average reaction time of 26.5 seconds. 83% were able to do withdrawals and 75% were able to do money transfers. This research suggests those using VR will improve real life situations compared those learnt from a power which overall proves VR used for TBI is beneficial for improving real life situation as VR rehabilitation.
