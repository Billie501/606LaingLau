    <h1>Choices associated with Virtual Reality as a use of Rehabilitation for Traumatic Brain Injury</h1>
    
    <h3>Effectiveness compared to traditional therapies</h3>
	<p>There are some effectiveness of the use of Virtual Reality (VR) for rehabilitation compared to cognitive rehabilitation. In a study conducting of 100 patients with mild to moderate Traumatic Brain Injury between the ages of 30 to 50 years of age which 56% where male and 34% were female which took part in a test where 50% did a Cognitive rehabilitation and another 50% did Virtual Reality rehabilitation (Mary H Kosmidis…2019). Results were quite similar around the same age group and gender considering its value to be p = 0.22 and        p = 0.22 in gender (Mary H Kosmidis…2019). Both treatments were helpful in treating patients with TBI especially in mood. Patients receiving VRT(virtual reality treatment) outperformed those receiving conventional therapy in the areas of cognition and mood. The cognitive flexibility, attention, executive skills, and visuospatial abilities that are crucial for daily functioning were all improved by VRT. Previous research on a range of neurological illnesses has also shown that VRT has beneficial benefits on cognition, motor function, and attention. The process with this type of technology is still evolving however according to (Dahdah et al. 2017) it is concluded test and data like this makesVR more effective in improve functions and speed of information processing of patients with TBI as this include motivation, and enjoyment of patients leading to a successful cause compared to traditional therapies.</p>
