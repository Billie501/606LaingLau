<h1>Our Topic: The use of VR in brain injury rehabilitation</h1>


</ul><h5><p>The page or area describing your chosen technology/topic and why it is significant and/or has important implications for society.<p></h5>
<p>To explain how virtual reality works in rehabilitation for traumatic brain injury, Segawa et al., 2020 explains it as a simulation of visual and audio effects generated by a computer. The experience is said to be immersive if it is experienced through special equipment to represent a real life situation or occurrence. The experience is said to be desktop or non-immersive if experienced through a computer monitor or screen. This report will discuss immersive and non-immersive virtual reality.
The importance of practicing an appropriate method for rehabilitation has been cited as imperative in an article by (Shen et al., 2022). </p>
	
<p>This importance of selecting the right rehabilitation method is linked to the overall “quality of life”, (Shen et al., 2022).  for the patient as well as “their daily behaviours”, (Shen et al., 2022). For example, in a study discussed by (Shen et al., 2022) of children between the age of 7 and 17,  the rehabilitation method had a correlation with attention related problems, educational capacity and how the child performs socially in society. </p>
 <p>It is important to note that there is limited research and studies conducted about traumatic brain injury rehabilitation. This is partially due to the complexity of comparing patients and rehabilitation methods with the varying degrees and levels of each patients trauma. The findings in this report are derived from their own unique studies and these studies should not necessarily be compared as they most likely target different demographics of people with different variations of traumatic brain injury using different virtual reality rehabilitation tools..
