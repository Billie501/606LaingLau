<h1>Opportunities associated with the use of VR in brain injury rehabilitation</h1>

<body>

<h3>Provides better stimulation of real-life situations</h3>
	<p>Virtual Reality treatment helps with real life situations. A study in Japan of 24 patients with TBI between the ages 18 and 65 were experimented with using an ATM in VR and applying it into real life situations (Kenneth NK Fong…2010). Two groups were experimented that concludes first group for patients to be taught with using an ATM using VR learning the ability of using debit cards, withdrawals and deposits unlike first group, the second group were taught using powerpoints rather in a virtual environment. Results showed Group 1 succeeded in learning a real ATM at an average time of 15.5 seconds and those who failed had an average reaction time of 26.5 seconds. 83% were able to do withdrawals and 75% were able to do money transfers. This research suggests those using VR will improve real life situations compared those learnt from a power which overall proves VR used for TBI is beneficial for improving real life situation as VR rehabilitation.

	<h3>Increase physical engagement and motivation </h3>
	<p>
VR rehabilitation enhances the walking ability of children. A study with 12 children with acquired brain injury with the mean age = 12.1 +/- 3.8 years old underwent a 10 session with the Gail Real-time Analysis Interactive-Lab (GAIL) for VR rehabilitation. These children were measured before and after of each test that consists of their GMFM, FAQ, 6-min walk test, 3D-GAIT analysis and overground. Overall results concluded Gross motor abilities was p=0.0002, standing p=0.005, walking p= 0.005, 6-minute walk test p=0.002, controlling in own decision in daily activities p=0.025 (Emilia.B et al…2017). Results from this test shown in this resource shows the ability VR rehabilitation in enhancing their engagement while regaining their physical ability and overall wellbeing.
