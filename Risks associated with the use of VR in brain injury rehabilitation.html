<h1>Risks associated with the use of VR in brain injury rehabilitation</h1><br>
	
	<body>	<h3>Simulator Sickness</h3><br>
A small study was discussed by (Shen et al., 2022). in which 24 patients under the age of 17 with Traumatic Brain Injury were assessed whilst receiving Immersive Virtual Reality treatment. The study examined the usability of a Virtual Reality Treatment and through this, simulator sickness, levels of exertion and levels of fun were assessed. Simulator sickness has similar symptoms to motion sickness and can be described as a feeling of “general discomfort” sometimes accompanied with nausea and headaches (Shen et al., 2022). The study indicated a presence of simulator sickness. Although the study found that levels of simulator sickness ranked lower in comparison to higher levels of enjoyment whilst using the virtual reality tool, it is important to recognise that there were some feelings of discomfort in the patients even though they were slight. Simulator sickness symptoms were found to be more likely to occur in female patients as well as younger patients. Regarding the younger patients, there is speculation that they may have less experience playing video games therefore making them more susceptible to feelings of simulator sickness. These findings have not been confirmed.
In addition, regarding an article written by (Lim et al., 2023) following a study of 78 patients reported to have brain injury, the findings of adverse effects are slight but quite alarming. Immersive Virtual Reality treatment was used and it found 7 patients suffered adverse side effects. These 7 patients expressed feelings of being dizzy with one patient requesting to withdraw from the treatment after 5 minutes of initiation. Another patient whilst standing expressed a fear of falling and requested to sit down to continue the treatment. Although it is noted that the dizzy spells lasted for a duration of no longer than 10 minutes it was fortunate that no patients fell or suffered worse effects.

<h3>Frightening</h3>  
An article was published by (Davies et al., 1999) where a study of brain injury patients utilised desktop virtual reality simulation to make coffee. The patients commented on the graphics used in the simulation particularly “the way objects suddenly came towards them and just hung in the air” (Davies et al., 1999). This was said to be disturbing and frightening. Itis important to note that situations like these could lead to panic and anxiety amongst the brain injury patients.
<br> 
<br> 		
<h3>Exertion</h3> 
In an article written by (Törnbom & Danielsson, 2018) following a study of 10 patients after a stroke or acquired brain injury,  patients were surveyed after a virtual experience of walking on a treadmill. Four patients described the experience as difficult and expressed feelings of exhaustion. They experienced feelings of fatigue noting that they needed to rest for a few hours after the experience. As a result, these patients did not enjoy the experience.

<h3>Might remove this..Not necessarily high enjoyment levels </h3>  <br> 
		
To talk briefly about the enjoyment levels of Virtual Reality rehabilitation, it might not always be as exciting and fun as the media sometimes portray it to be.  (Shen et al., 2022) reported that teenage patients were less likely to attend a follow up virtual reality therapy appointment and gave the level of fun a low score. There are many reasons why this could be. (Shen et al., 2022) speculates the teenagers have been exposed to the high enjoyment levels from marketed video games. These video games are designed purely for fun and entertainment while the virtual reality treatment is designed for life rehabilitation. Video games and virtual reality rehabilitation are not equally comparable however this might not be the case to a teenager.
